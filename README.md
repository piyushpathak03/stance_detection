# Stance Detection for the Fake News Challenge with Conditional Encoding and Attention LSTM
Stance Detection Model developed by Stephen Pfohl, Oskar Triebe and Ferdinand Legros for the Fake News Challenge with Conditional Encoding and Attention LSTM, as Stanford CS224N class project.

Additional to the code written for the Fake News Challenge (http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/), the poster and paper presenting the work done are included.

Our motivation to publish this is to help other researchers kickstart their projects. Please feel free to use under appropriate attribution.
